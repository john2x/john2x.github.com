## What is doqdoq.com?
It is a free service to host your images. You will be able to share your images across social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. Hot-linking to images is also allowed. Try it out at [doqdoq.com]( http://doqdoq.com ).

Built in collaboration with my [brother][] on the [Django][] web framework.
