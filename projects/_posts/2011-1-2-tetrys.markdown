## My Humble Foray into Game Development
Cloning Tetris is considered by many to be the [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=206331) for budding game developers. The game is simple enough for beginners to replicate, but it has all the basic components of a good game. Graphics, sound, user input and controls, scoring, win and lose conditions and basic collision detection. There is no AI involved, which is quite intimidating even to someone much more experienced.
