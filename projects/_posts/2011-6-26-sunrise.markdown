<h2 id="what-is-sunrise">What is Sunrise?</h2>
Sunrise is a free WordPress photo blogging theme. It is inspired by magazine foldouts and poster design. 

### Features ###

- Full background photos
- Simple and minimalist design
- Use WordPress' "Featured Image" for your photos
- "Show/Hide Info" toggle for a better view of your photos
- Display thumbnails on homepage for better viewing 

### Limitations ###

- Categories don't work (yet)
- Opera doesn't play too well with the full background image
- Internet Explorer doesn't support transparent backgrounds, so the text will fallback to a non-transparent background
- Comments are disabled (no plans on adding them yet)
