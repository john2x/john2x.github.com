## What is r.doqdoq.com?
[codredd.net](http://coderedd.net) was supposed to be called coderedd.it, but I couldn't buy the domain so I had to make do with what I had. 

It is a website which allows you to browse [Reddit][] like you're reading code in your favorite programming language. 

It runs on [Flask][] using the [reddit\_api][api] library.

Read through the Reddit [thread][] for more info or check out the [source][] and contribute a template.
